# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Members Hierarchy Application

Thanks for reading my React assignment!

This application displays all members from the server. Once a specific member is selected, the full hierarchy is displayed up to the root member.

## Technologies

- **Vite**: The project was created using Vite, a  tool for modern web projects.
- **Material-UI**: Components are build and designed using Material-UI.
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching are managed with React Query, which caches data for a configured amount of milliseconds.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making requests to the members API.

## Features

- **Display Members**: Fetches and displays a list of all members from the server.
- **View Hierarchy**: Displays the full hierarchy of a selected member, up to the root member.
- **Caching**: Data is cached using React Query to minimize network requests.
